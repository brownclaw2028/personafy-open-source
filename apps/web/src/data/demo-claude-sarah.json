Start with these classics: 1) Beef bourguignon -- the quintessential Dutch oven recipe. 2) No-knead artisan bread -- the Le Creuset creates an amazing crust. 3) Osso buco for Italian comfort. 4) Cassoulet for a weekend project. 5) Ratatouille -- beautiful in that Flame color.",

Try a classic French onion soup or a braised short rib. The Flame color makes a stunning centerpiece. To reduce delivery orders, try Sunday batch cooking in the Le Creuset: a big stew or braise that gives you meals for 3-4 days.",
