Since you love the Pegasus line, here are some options:\n\n1. **Nike Pegasus 41** ($130) - Natural upgrade, improved ZoomX foam\n2. **Nike Vomero 18** ($160) - More cushion for long runs\n3. **Brooks Ghost 16** ($140) - Excellent neutral cushioning\n4. **New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v14** ($165) - Plush long-distance comfort\n\nSince you're running 4x/week with increasing mileage for half marathon training, I'd actually suggest having two pairs - your Pegasus for speed work and a more cushioned shoe for long runs. The Vomero 18 pairs perfectly with your current rotation. Want me to compare any of these in detail?"] },

Here's why:\n\n**Global Entry vs TSA PreCheck:**\n- Global Entry: $100/5 years = $20/year (INCLUDES TSA PreCheck)\n- TSA PreCheck alone: $85/5 years = $17/year\n- Extra $15 total for international fast-track = no-brainer\n\n**Benefits for Your Travel Style:**\n- Skip customs lines on international returns (saves 30-60 min)\n- TSA PreCheck included (keep your current benefits)\n- Works at 75+ countries for faster entry\n- Many premium credit cards reimburse the $100 fee\n\n**Application Tips:**\n1. Apply online at Global Entry website\n2. Conditional approval in 2-4 weeks\n3. Schedule interview at your nearest airport\n4. Bring passport + one other ID\n5. Interview takes 15 minutes\n\n**Pro tip for window seat lovers:** With Global Entry, you breeze through customs so fast you'll have time to grab food before connecting flights. Combined with your window seat for sleeping, you'll arrive refreshed.\n\nCheck if your credit card already covers the fee - many travel cards do.
