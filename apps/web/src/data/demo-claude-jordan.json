Mauerpark Sunday flea market is a must -- arrive early for the best picks. Budget tip: pay by weight at Garage (around EUR 15/kg). Bring an extra bag for your finds -- or ship them home to save carry-on space.",

Top routes: 1) Lady Bird Lake Trail (10 miles, flat, scenic -- perfect for easy rides). 2) Veloway (3.1-mile loop, bike-only, great for speed work). 3) Barton Creek Greenbelt (more technical if you want mountain biking). 4) Shoal Creek Trail (connects north Austin to downtown). For commuting, the Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge connects South Austin to downtown beautifully. Pair cycling with your yoga days for great recovery.",
