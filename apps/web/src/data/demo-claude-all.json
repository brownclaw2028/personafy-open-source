First, `Partial<T>` and `Required<T>` are essentials for component props. Then there's `Pick<T, K>` and `Omit<T, K>` for creating prop subsets. For async patterns, `Awaited<T>` is fantastic for unwrapping Promise types. Since you mentioned React, `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` is incredibly useful for extending component props. And `Record<K, V>` is great for typed dictionaries. Want me to dive deeper into any of these?",

Your pollinator garden probably attracts hummingbirds. Tip: keep a simple journal of what you see and when.",

Try using the windowpane test: stretch a small piece of dough -- if it holds without tearing, bulk is done. Other tips: cold retard in the fridge overnight after shaping gives better flavor AND oven spring. Score confidently with a sharp lame.
