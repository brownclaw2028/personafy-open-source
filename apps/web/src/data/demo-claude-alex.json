First, `Partial<T>` and `Required<T>` are essentials for component props. Then there's `Pick<T, K>` and `Omit<T, K>` for creating prop subsets. For async patterns, `Awaited<T>` is fantastic for unwrapping Promise types. Since you mentioned React, `ComponentProps<typeof Component>` is incredibly useful for extending component props. And `Record<K, V>` is great for typed dictionaries. Want me to dive deeper into any of these?",

        "text": "For bouldering trips to Joshua Tree and Yosemite, the Organic Big Pad or Metolius Session II are top picks. Since you're carry-on only on United/Alaska, you'll likely need to check the pad or drive. For road trips from SF, consider a pad with backpack straps for the approach. Pro tip: the Organic pads fold to fit in most car trunks easily.",
