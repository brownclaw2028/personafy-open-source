Tips for tighter dovetails: 1) Mark your baseline with a cutting gauge, not a pencil -- the scored line gives your chisel a registration point. 2) Saw to the waste side of the line, then pare to the line. 3) Use a sharp marking knife (not pencil) for transferring pins to tails. 4) Keep your chisels razor sharp -- hone before every session. 5) Try the 'Rob Cosman method' of undercutting the baseline slightly for a visual gap-free fit. Since you shop at Rockler, their premium chisels are worth the upgrade if you haven't already.",

Getting started: 1) Contact Portland Public Schools' volunteer coordinator -- they always need mentors. 2) SMART (Start Making A Reader Today) is an Oregon-specific program that pairs volunteers with young readers. 3) For the library, propose a 'history alive' program where you bring historical topics to life for kids. 4) SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives) if you want to mentor adults too. Start with one commitment and build -- sustainability is key.",

Ideas: teach about Lewis & Clark expedition using local landscapes, Oregon Trail history through hands-on activities, indigenous peoples' relationship with Pacific Northwest ecology. Bring in your handmade wooden toys as props -- kids learn better with tangible objects. Your grandkids can be your test audience. Consider partnering with the Oregon Historical Society for materials and credibility.",

Beyond the well-known ones, try: 1) Wayfinder Beer (excellent lagers and Czech-style pilsners). 2) Culmination Brewing (innovative small batches). 3) Great Notion (hazies and pastry stouts if you're adventurous). 4) Upright Brewing (farmhouse ales in the basement of the Leftbank building). 5) Von Ebert at Glendoveer (great beer AND disc golf). For coffee: try Sterling Coffee Roasters, Heart Coffee, and Coava -- all excellent dark roasts.",
